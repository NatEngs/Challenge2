    <section class="about">
        <a href="#me"></a><p>I've spent the last 18 years in People Management and Program Managment at two Top 50 Fortune Companies. I have honed my business skills and discovered along the way my love of building things.  First with my free-time constructing furniture and various projects in my garage woodshop, and recently, creating virtual tools and websites by learning full-stack coding.  I am seeking challenges that will satisfy my goals of leading people, constructing new tools and services, and innovating through experimentation and bringing visions to reality.</p>
