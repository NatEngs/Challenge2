        <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I enjoy building things.  In over 18 years of management and team leadership experience, I've built high-performing teams that can adaptively respond to an ever changing environment to execute at their top potential.  In my free time, I spend time in my garage-shop solving different challenges - I've been working towards my goal of having all furniture and finishes in my home made with my own hands.  Bunk beds, built-ins, and bedroom sets.  The list continues to grow.  If it's got doors or drawers, I've probably built it!  I've recently applied this love of building, and problem solving, to learning to code.  I've built people up with my leadership, furniture with my hands, and now it's time to build things with my mind.</p>
